Volkswagen Carnet - An home assistant plugin to add integration with your car
============================================================
Description
------------
This platform plugin allows you to see some information from volkswagen carnet related to your car that has a valid carnet subscription.

It also allows you to trigger some functions like start climatisation if your car supports that.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have a account on volkswagen carnet.

Clone or copy the root of the repository into `<config dir>/custom_components`

Add a volkswagen_carnet configuration block to your `<config dir>/configuration.yaml`
```yaml
volkswagen_carnet:
    username: <username to volkswagen carnet>
    password: <password to volkswagen carnet>
    update_interval: 
        minutes: 5 # specify in minutes how often to fetch status data from carnet (optional, default 3 min, minimum 3 min)
```

Start the Home Assistant service with the configuration below, check "states" in Home Assistant to find out your CarNet ID, replace vw_carid with your ID throughout the example configuration below, save the config files and restart Home Assistant.

Example: ```switch.vw_carid_charging ---> switch.wvwzzzXczheXXXXXXX_charging```
